    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."
   ]

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "What wer'er trying to do here is test the hypothesis that race plays a factor on the success of job applicants to receive more interest by potential employers, by measuring the number of call-backs each applicant got. Because the test used randomization to determine whether an applicant (with specific demographics, like age, experience, name) has a race of black or white, this study is ONE possible scenario out of many. So, we need to make sure that in other scenarios, the results that we got, where black applicants had less responses then did white applicants, are actually significant. \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "To determine whether or not this result is significant, we first calculate the sample probability of success for each race: number of call backs over the number of applicants in that race. Doing this, we see that the probability in this experiment of a white applicant receiving a call  is 9.7%, and for blacks, is 6.4%. At first, this looks like there is some racial discrimination. But to make sure, we test the significance of this test by finding the confidence inverval and p-value give our nuill hypothesis and alpha threshold of 5%. Using the binomial test and the alternative hypothesis that the probability of In the results we see that the p-value (9.7e-9) is much much less than our alpha 5%. <b>Thus, we should reject the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis that the the probability of  black applicants receiving a call back is less than the probability of white applicants in receiving a call back</b>"
